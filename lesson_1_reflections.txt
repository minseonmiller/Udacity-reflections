How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
It was easy to find out bugs, and save my time to go through entire code one by one.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
I don't have to worry about accidently deleting files, or sudden program crash. Version control will have previous files I have been working on so I can restore it whenever I need. That will save my time.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
Auto save takes up alot of room, however it can prevent man made error.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
because some cases they are connected?

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
if I need to compare two files, instead of going through all lines, I can just git diff and see which line is different.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something? I know how to fix it. git checkout.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for? html?
